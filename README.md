### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is [Shane Putnam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-putnam-phd-65132072/) (he/him), and I am a hydrologist and programmer at [Dewberry](https://www.dewberry.com/). I am a founding member of the Computational Science and Informatics (CSI) group, and I get to spend my day working with an amazing team of scientists and engineers who fell in love with programming. We combine our subject matter expertise with our programming skills to deliver innovative solutions to risk and resilience studies for local, state, and federal partners. 

I bring my expertise as a statistical hydrologist to the team and have worked on a variety of projects that involve flood risk analysis, flood forecasting, H&H modeling, and national scale data refinement. I first learned Python to perform data analyses and run hydrologic models in graduate school and have since expanded my skills as both a geospatial and full stack developer. Here are a few of the tools, frameworks, and go-to tech I use every day:
